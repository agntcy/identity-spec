# Intro

`Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)` are innovative identifiers designed for verifiable, decentralized digital identity.

Unlike traditional identifiers, `DIDs` are independent of centralized systems, allowing the controller to prove control without external permission. They are formatted as URIs, linking a `DID` subject to a `DID` document, which includes cryptographic material, verification methods, and services. This setup enables trusted interactions and can represent various subjects, such as agents, locators or other `Agntcy` data models. Key components include `DID` syntax, documents, core properties, serialized formats, operations, and resolution processes.

You can find below examples of `DIDs` and `DID Documents`, including the ones defined for `AGNTCY` standards:

- [`DID`](/docs/did)
- [`DID Document`](/docs/did/did-document)
