# Intro

Let's discover **Agent Identity**, part of [`AGNTCY`](https://agntcy.org/), an open source collective for inter-agent collaboration.

The `AGNTCY` is where we are building the Internet of Agents to be accessible for all: A diverse, collaborative space to innovate, develop, and maintain software components and services for agentic workflows and multi-agent applications.
