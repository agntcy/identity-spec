# Intro

# Agntcy

Let's discover **Identity**, part of [`AGNTCY`](https://agntcy.org/), an open source collective for inter-agent collaboration.

The `AGNTCY` is where we are building the Internet of Agents to be accessible for all: A diverse, collaborative space to innovate, develop, and maintain software components and services for agentic workflows and multi-agent applications.

# Identity

Decentralized Identity systems and [`Verifiable Credentials (VC)`](/docs/category/verifiable-credentials) offer a robust framework for secure and privacy-respecting identity verification, empowering agents to facilitate interactions between individuals and services.

In these systems, agents can be software applications that manage identity attributes stored on decentralized networks, through [`Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)`](/docs/category/decentralized-identifiers). They play a crucial role in credential management, allowing users to store, authenticate, and selectively disclose their [`Verifiable Credentials (VC)`](/docs/category/verifiable-credentials), which are cryptographically secure and tamper-proof.

[`Verifiable Credentials (VC)`](/docs/category/verifiable-credentials) can be utilized to verify the origin of agents and their versioning, facilitating secure multi-factor authentication (MFA) and authorization processes between agents.
