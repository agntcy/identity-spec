# Intro

**Identity** supports various types of identifiers, referred to as `IDs`, which serve as unique markers for different entities operated by the `AGNTCY` (Ex. agent).

These identifiers are paired with `ID Documents`, which contain the necessary information that can be used to establish trust in interactions with that entity.

### Definitions

- `ID`: An identifier used to represent the identity of a subject.
- `ID Document`: A document containing cryptographic material and verification methods to establish trust.

### Examples

You can find in the [`Decentralized Identifiers`](/docs/id/did) section some examples of `IDs` and `ID Documents`, modelized as [`Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.1`](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.1/).
