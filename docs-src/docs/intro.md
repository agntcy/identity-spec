# Intro

# Agntcy

Let's discover **Identity**, part of [`AGNTCY`](https://agntcy.org/), an open source collective for inter-agent collaboration.

The `AGNTCY` is where we are building the Internet of Agents to be accessible for all: A diverse, collaborative space to innovate, develop, and maintain software components and services for agentic workflows and multi-agent applications.

# Identity

Ensuring secure and dependable communication between software agents is vital for building a trustworthy network. Much like humans use official documents such as passports to authenticate themselves in real-world interactions, software agents require reliable credentials to confirm their trustworthiness. Without effective authentication, unverified or malicious agents could disrupt the network, potentially causing misinformation, fraud, or security vulnerabilities. Thus, a consistent and standardized approach to authenticating agents and validating their metadata is critical for fostering secure and reliable interactions across the IoA ecosystem.

The "Agent Identity" component (or simply "Identity") is a system that leverages decentralized technologies to manage and verify the identities of Agents issued by any organization, ensuring secure and trustworthy interactions.

Decentralized Identity systems and [`Verifiable Credentials (VC)`](/docs/category/verifiable-credentials) offer a robust framework for secure and privacy-respecting identity verification, empowering agents to facilitate interactions between individuals and services.

In these systems, agents can be software applications that manage identity attributes stored on decentralized networks, through [`Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)`](/docs/category/identifiers). They play a crucial role in credential management, allowing users to store, authenticate, and selectively disclose their [`Verifiable Credentials (VC)`](/docs/category/verifiable-credentials), which are cryptographically secure and tamper-proof.

[`Verifiable Credentials (VC)`](/docs/category/verifiable-credentials) can be utilized to verify the origin of agents and their versioning, facilitating secure multi-factor authentication (MFA) and authorization processes between agents.
