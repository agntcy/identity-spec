# Post-Quantum Safe

As quantum computing technology advances, traditional cryptographic algorithms become vulnerable to quantum attacks. To address this challenge, post-quantum cryptography aims to develop algorithms that remain secure against quantum adversaries.

We support, as an option, the following quantum-safe cryptographic algorithm defined by [`NIST`](https://www.nist.gov/):

## [`NTRU-Falcon`](https://falcon-sign.info/)

- **Purpose**: `NTRU-Falcon` is a cryptographic algorithm designed to be secure in the presence of quantum computing capabilities. It is part of the family of lattice-based cryptographic schemes.
- **Features**: Known for its efficiency and strong security properties, `NTRU-Falcon` is suitable for applications requiring fast encryption and decryption processes while maintaining robust security.
- **Adoption**: As a quantum-safe option, `NTRU-Falcon` is considered a promising candidate for future-proofing cryptographic systems against quantum threats.
