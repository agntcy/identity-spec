# Post-Quantum Safe

As industry makes progress in quantum computing technology, traditional cryptographic algorithms, such as Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), may become vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers. To address this challenge, **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** efforts aim to develop algorithms that remain secure even in the presence of large-scale quantum computers.

In light of this, the [`AGNTCY`](https://agntcy.org/) will support various post-quantum algorithms, including **NIST-approved** ones, which are available as optional key types through the AGNTCY's cryptographic interface.

To become familiar with PQC algorithms and naming conventions, please refer to the [NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Project](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography).

## ðŸ”’ JWK Integration

PQC algorithms can be represented using the **JSON Web Key (JWK)** format, with extensions to support new key types:

```json
{
    "kid": "T4xl70S7MT6Zeq6r9V9fPJGVn76wfnXJ21-gyo0Gu6o",
    "kty": "AKP",
    "alg": "ML-DSA-44",
    "pub": "base64url-encoded-public-key",
    "seed": "base64url-encoded-32-byte-seed",
    "priv": "base64url-encoded-private-key"
}
