# Post-Quantum Safe

As quantum computing technology advances, traditional cryptographic algorithms (such as RSA and ECC) become vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers. To address this challenge, **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** aims to develop algorithms that remain secure even in the presence of large-scale quantum computers.

This project supports a selection of **NIST-approved** post-quantum algorithms that are available as optional key types in our cryptographic interface.

We align with the algorithm families and naming conventions from the [NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Project](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography).

## ðŸ”’ JWK Integration

Post-Quantum algorithms can be represented using **JSON Web Key (JWK)** format, with extensions to support new key types:

```json
