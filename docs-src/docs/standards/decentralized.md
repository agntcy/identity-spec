# Decentralized

The concept of `Decentralized Identity` focuses on providing individuals with greater control over their personal data and digital identities.

The `Identity` platform adheres to key standards set by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/) to ensure interoperability, security, and reliability. These standards include:

## [`Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.1`](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.1/)

- **Purpose**: `DIDs` are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, self-sovereign digital identities. Unlike centralized identifiers, `DIDs` are not controlled by any single organization.
- **Structure**: `DIDs` consist of a URI scheme that supports decentralized identity management. They are designed to be globally unique and resolvable, meaning they can be used across different systems.
- **Use Cases**: `DIDs` are used to identify entities such as individuals, organizations, and devices in a decentralized manner, enabling privacy and control over identity data.

## [`Verifiable Credentials (VCs) v2.0`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/)

- **Purpose**: `VCs` allow individuals and organizations to present information in a secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable way. They are digital equivalents of physical credentials like driver's licenses or diplomas.
- **Structure**: `VCs` consist of claims made by an issuer about a subject, and they are cryptographically secure to ensure authenticity and integrity.
- **Benefits**: `VCs` enhance trust between parties by allowing credential holders to prove claims without revealing unnecessary personal information.
